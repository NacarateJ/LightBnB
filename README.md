# LightBnB

LightBnB is a web application designed to revolutionize the travel industry. It provides a platform for homeowners to rent out their properties to vacationers, offering an alternative to hotels and bed and breakfasts.

The main objective of this project is to design and create a PostgreSQL database using an entity relationship diagram (ERD) and to connect it to the [LightBnB web app](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/LightBnB_WebApp) provided by [LHL](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en). This allows for interaction with the data from a web page using a JavaScript app and the node-postgres library.
